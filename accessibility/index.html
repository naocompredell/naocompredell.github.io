<ol>
  <li>Via the <a href="https://github.com">GitHub.com</a> or <a href="https://enterprise.github.com">GitHub Enterprise</a> web interface through a modern browser</li>
  <li>Via the <a href="https://desktop.github.com">GitHub Desktop</a> application</li>
  <li>Via the GitHub’s open <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/">application programming interface</a> (API) which provides information in a machine-readable format for integration with other applications</li>
  <li>Via the open source <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> command line (interactive, entirely text-bassed) interface</li>
